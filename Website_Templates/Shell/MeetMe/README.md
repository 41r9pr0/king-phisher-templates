# MeetNow Webmeeting Website

## Objective
Credentials *and* Shell for calendar updates

## Pretext
You are sending a calendar invite and meetnow is the new meeting portal the company is using.

First the user is asked to enter a MeetMe number to join the meeting. The company is requesting you to log in with your credentials to verify you are who you are. Next, you'll be asked to download the client in order to join the meeting.

## Modify
1. File: MeetMe_Client_v3.5.3.exe
  * Create a custom executable file.
  * Use Empire or Veil if possible to avoid anti-virus detection.
  * Make sure to name your executable 'MeetMe_Client_v3.5.3.exe' or you will have to edit the link in the 'failed' page.
